# Quizify

🎯 Quizify

📖 Overview

Quizify is an interactive and engaging quiz application built using Python, Tkinter, and QRCode.
The project provides a fun learning experience through a user-friendly graphical interface, real-time score tracking, and time-based question answering. Users can answer multiple-choice questions within a countdown timer, receive instant feedback for each response, and view their final results at the end.

At the end of the quiz, Quizify generates a unique QR code containing the user’s performance summary as a digital reward — combining interactivity, gamification, and Python-based GUI design in one creative project.
